## Introduction
The APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) score is a widely used scoring system in critical care medicine. It is designed assess the severity of illness and predict the risk of mortality for patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). The score takes into account various physiological parameters and patient characteristics to provide a numerical value that reflects the overall condition of the patient.

The APACHE II score is commonly used for risk stratification, clinical decision-making, and outcome prediction in critically ill patients. It helps healthcare professionals evaluate the severity of a patient's illness, monitor their progress, and make informed treatment decisions.

## Usage
To calculate the APACHE II score using this code, follow these steps:

1. Run the code a Python environment.
2. When prompted, enter the patient's information as requested (e.g., age, temperature, blood pressure, etc.).
3. After providing all the required information, the code will calculate the APACHE II score based on the given inputs.
4. The calculated APACHE II score will displayed on the screen.

## Explanation
The APACHE II score is calculated based on several physiological parameters and patient characteristics. Here's explanation of each step involved in the calculation:

1. **Gather Patient Information**: The code prompts the user to enter various patient details such as age, temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, pH level, serum sodium and potassium levels, creatinine level, hematocrit level, white blood cell count, and Glasgow Coma Scale score.

2. **Calculate the APACHE II Score**: The code initializes the APACHE score to zero and then applies a scoring system based on the entered patient information. Each parameter is evaluated against specific criteria, and corresponding points are assigned accordingly. The total score is calculated by summing up the points from each parameter.

3. **Interpreting the APACHE II Score**: The higher the APACHE score, the greater the severity of illness and the higher the risk of mortality. The score can used to assess the overall condition of the patient and guide treatment decisions.

The code provided calculates the APACHE II score based on the inputted patient information and returns the score as an output.

## How to Run
To run the code and calculate the APACHE II score:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. Copy the provided code into a Python file (e.g., `apache_ii_score.py`).
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the Python file is located.
4. Run the following command: `python apache_ii_score.py`
5. Follow the prompts to enter the patient's information as requested.
6. Once all the information is provided, the calculated APACHE II score will be displayed on the screen.
